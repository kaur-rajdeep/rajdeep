          I'm a Computer Science Student, all by coincidences. I didn't know a
          lot about how to code initially, so I started with learning python,
          then did the basic DSA, later on found about frontend development, I
          love working with websites, you know the part when you feel good about
          building things as you imagine, so here I am. I volunteer for
          Techshilla, Baru Sahib. A startup based upon uplifting girls. I've
          also been part of GirlScript Summer of Code 2023, as an Open Source
          Contributor. Filled with hope and compassion I believe this world can
          be a better place to live in.
